Define Requirements
=======================================

The following user stories describe how someone responsible for building
and managing synchronization processes can use RESTful web services:

1. I can invoke a RESTful Web service.
2. I can specify a resource using a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
3. I can specify the common HTTP methods for the resource, 
   such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to create, retrieve, update, and delete resources, respectively.
4. I can add headers to the request.
5. I can pass query parameters to the request.
6. I can dynamically update header and parameter values.
7. I can specify paging options for resource and use values from the response.
8. I can limit the number of rows to read from response.
9. I can map a value from JSON response to a field on a Sitecore item.
10. **FUTURE** I can access the resource using API keys, basic authentication, or OAuth 2.0. 

.. note::
    The ability to create data to post and update will be available in future releases along
    with support for basic authentication and OAuth 2.0.
